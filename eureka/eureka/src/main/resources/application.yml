    #.1>fetch-registry: false
    #Example Situation:
    #Suppose you have Service D that you want to configure, but it does not need to find other services:

    #Setting: fetch-registry: false
    #This means Service D will not look up or try to get the list
    #of other services (like Service A, B, or C) from the Eureka server.
    #It won't care about the other services at all.


    #2.register-with-eureka: false
    #Example Situation: Now imagine you have another
    #service called Service E that you want to configure as a standalone utility:
    #
    #Setting: register-with-eureka: false
    #This means Service E will not register itself with the Eureka server.
    #Other services will not be able to see or communicate with ServiceE through Eureka.


    #Service D won't look for other services and will not care about
    #what other services are available.

    #Service E wonâ€™t let other services know it exists.
